# String VM

*SVM* is an experimental computing environment.
It is characterized by textual memory representation, this means, program states are visible as little-structural string format.

## Goals

- Understanding basics of computer architecture
- Understanding programming languages


## Tools

- virtual machine
- assembler
- loader
- high-level programming language (like lisp?)

## Documentations

- [textual memory format]()
- [VM instructions]()

### Data types

- byte
- bytes
- UTF-8 characters
- UTF-8 character strings
